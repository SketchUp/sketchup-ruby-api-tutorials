      # We need a reference to the currently active model. The SketchUp API
      # currently only lets you work on the active model. Under Windows there
      # will be only one model open at a time, but under OS X there might be
      # multiple models open.
      # 
      # Beware that if there is no model open under OS X then `active_model`
      # will return nil. In this example we ignore that for simplicity.

      # Whenever you make changes to the model you must take care to use
      # `model.start_operation` and `model.commit_operation` to wrap everything
      # into a single undo step. Otherwise the user risks not being able to
      # undo everything and she may loose work.
      # 
      # Making sure your model changes are undoable in a single undo step is a
      # requirement of the Extension Warehouse submission quality checks.
      #

      # the Edit > Undo menu - so make sure you name your operations something
      # the users can understand.

      # Creating a group via the API is slightly different from creating a
      # group via the UI.  Via the UI you create the faces first, then group
      # them. But with the API you create the group first and then add its
      # content directly to the group.

      # Here we define a set of 3d points to create a 1x1m face. Note that the
      # internal unit in SketchUp is inches. This means that regardless of the
      # model unit settings the 3d data is always stored in inches.
      # 
      # In order to make it easier work with lengths the Numeric class has
      # been extended with some utility methods that let us write stuff like
      # `1.m` to represent a meter instead of `39.37007874015748`.

      ]

      # We pass the points to the `add_face` method and keep the returned
      # reference to the face as we want to keep working with it.
      # 
      # Note that normally the orientation (its normal) is a result of the order
      # of the 3d points you use to create it. The exception is when you create
      # a face on the ground plane (all points with z == 0) then it will always
      # be face down.
      face = entities.add_face(points)

      # Here we invoke SketchUp's push-pull functionality on the face. But note
      # that we must use a negative number in order for it to extrude upwards
      # in the positive direction of the Z-axis. This is because SketchUp
      # forced this face on the ground place to be face down.
      face.pushpull(-1.m)

      # Finally we are done and we close the operation. In production you will
      # want to catch errors and abort to clean up if your function failed.
      # But for simplicity we won't do this here.
